## Pi-Cartridge-Resetter
This repository is a collection of how I build my resetter and which sources & hardware I used.

Firstly a big shoutout to **haveblue** who wrote a perfectly detailed guide to get started. This wouldn't be possible without the basics he's giving in his guide. Furthermore I've to honor **woutervddn** who wrote basic bash scripts which automate the steps haveblue is describing in his guide. I used them to easily access the eeprom data. And of course I've to give credit to **bvanheu** for making decrypting these eeproms simply through his library.
