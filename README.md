## Pi-Cartridge-Resetter
So our school is paying 200$ per catridge which our Stratasys Dimension Elite is using. I knew the filament itself costs way less and I found bvanheu's library. Sneaks Hacks StratHacker is nice, but the documentation isn't that good and I'm missing a few things like using a pi zero to make it smaller or preselectinhg some settings before rewriting the eeprom.

So I decided to start this project to build myself my own Pi Cartridge Resetter. If you want to help, please contact me. I really need help in python :)
